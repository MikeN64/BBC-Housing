# Better BC Housing

> An interactive, user-friendly redesign of Boston College's housing registration system harnessing React, Node, and MongoDB.

## Inspiration
Having all experienced the frustration of registration for housing through BC's archaic housing registration system, we felt the need to modernize the system and developed a modern progressive web app version of the registration system.
### Primary Issues with the current registration system:
1. Poor user friendly design, forcing students to click through multiple pages and drop down menus to navigate through dorms.
2. Unresponsiveness makes it impossible to register on mobile.
3. No interactive visuals or graphics to guide students through process. Lack of clarity.

### How we aimed to solve these problems.
By using modern technologies such as React.js and Express.js, we implemented a snappy, responsive, and interactive web app to ease the frustrations of BC students.

We hope that this web app will encourage Boston College as well as many other colleges to consider upgrading their vital yet obsolete services.

## Features:
- Beautiful and interactive visual interface where students can click on their building and dorm room of choice through a map and floorplans rather than drop down menus with text.
- Live Dorm Picking! Hustle up because multiple people can all pick rooms at the same time.
- User friendly and responsive design for a smooth registration process. No more scrambling and clicking through pages.
- Single Page Application: no delay in page changes, snappy experience!
